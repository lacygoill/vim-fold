" Editing text in insert mode in a markdown buffer can sometimes be slow.

" MWE:
"
"     $ vim -Nu <(cat <<'EOF'
"     setl fdm=expr fde=Heading_depth(v:lnum)>0?'>1':'='
"     fu Heading_depth(lnum)
"         let nextline = getline(a:lnum+1)
"         let level = len(matchstr(getline(a:lnum), '^#\{1,6}'))
"         if !level
"             if nextline =~# '^=\+\s*$'
"                 return '>1'
"             elseif nextline =~# '^-\+\s*$'
"                 return '>2'
"             endif
"         endif
"         return level

"
" Vim takes several seconds to start.
" Now, press `I C-k C-k` to delete the rest of the line.
" Again, it takes several seconds.
"
" It seems the issue is `fold#md#fde#heading_depth()` which, for some reason, is
" called more than 180,000 times!
"
" I think  that every time  a character is inserted  or removed while  in insert
" mode, Vim has to  recompute the folding level of each line  above when using a
" foldexpr.
" That would  explain why  the issue  gets worse  as the  number of  lines above
" increases, and why it gets worse  as the number of inserted/removed characters
" increases.
"
" ---
"
" The main culprit is the value `'='` returned from `Heading_depth()`.
" If you replace it with `1`, the slowness disappears.
"}}}
"   Why can't I just use `>1` and `1` to fix this issue?{{{
"
" We don't want to use `1` in `fold#md#fde#stacked()`; see the comments there.
"
" Besides, for a given buffer, we may be using:
"
"    - a different foldexpr which also uses a costly value (e.g. `'='`, `'a123'`, `'s123'`)
"    - a different folding method which can still be slow (e.g. `syntax`)
"}}}
"Â     Ok, so how does `vim-fold` fix it?{{{
"
" It lets Vim create folds according to the value of `'fdm'` (e.g. `foldexpr` or
" `syntax`), then  it resets  the latter  to manual, which  is much  less costly
" because  it doesn't  ask Vim  to recompute  anything every  time you  edit the
" buffer.
"
" From `:h fold-methods`:
"
" >     Switching to  the "manual" method  doesn't remove the existing  folds.  This
" >     can be  used to first  define the folds  automatically and then  change them
" >     manually.
"
" ---
"
" You can observe the positive effect from `vim-fold` like this:
"
"     $ vim -Nu <(cat <<'EOF'
"     set rtp^=~/.vim/plugged/vim-fold | setl fdm=expr fde=Heading_depth(v:lnum)>0?'>1':'='
"     fu Heading_depth(lnum)
"         let level = len(matchstr(getline(a:lnum), '^#\{1,6}'))
"         if !level
"             if getline(a:lnum+1) =~ '^=\+\s*$'
"                 let level = 1
"             endif
"         endif
"         return level
"     endfu
"     ino <expr> <c-k><c-k> repeat('<del>', 300)
"     EOF
"     ) +"%d | put='text' | norm! yy300pG300Ax" /tmp/md.md
"
" If you get an error because of `lg#win_execute()`, add `vim-lg-lib` to the rtp.
" In any case, Vim should start up immediately, and removing 300 characters with
" `C-k C-k` should also be instantaneous.
"}}}

" Why could it be useful to disable the lazyfold feature in small files?{{{
"
" https://github.com/Konfekt/FastFold/pull/55
"}}}
"   How could I do it?{{{
"
" Initialize some constant:
"
"     const s:MIN_LINES = 30
"
" Write this function:
"
"     fu s:is_small() abort
"         return line('$') <= s:MIN_LINES
"     endfu
"
" And update `s:should_skip()` to include it:
"
"     return s:is_small() || !s:is_costly() || !empty(&bt) || !&l:ma
"            ^^^^^^^^^^^^
"}}}
"   Which pitfalls should I be aware of?{{{
"
" `s:MIN_LINES` adds complexity; not in terms of number of lines of code, but in
" terms of the logic; it increases the number of code paths.
"
" Suppose the script contains a bug which  can be reproduced when some options A
" and B are both on, or both off.
" But during your tests, you can't reproduce with A and B off, because you use a
" small file.
" You'll come to the conclusion that the bug  is only triggered when A and B are
" on; you may find a solution, but you won't have fixed the bug in all cases.
"
" Also, you may sometimes reproduce the issue, but not always, because you don't
" know or  have forgotten about the  fact that the  number of lines in  the file
" matters.
"
" More generally, the more  code paths, the harder it is to  debug and reason on
" issues.
"
" ---
"
" If you choose a too big value, you may experience lag too frequently.
"
" Whatever value you use for `s:MIN_LINES`, make this experiment:
"
"                                           replace with the new number you want to use (minus 3)
"                                           vvv  vvv
"         $ vim +"%d | put='text' | norm! yy123pG123Ax" /tmp/md.md
"         " make sure that 'fdm' is 'expr'
"         " press:  I C-k C-k
"
" Check how much time it takes for Vim to remove all the characters.
" Choose a value for which the time is acceptable.
"
" 30 seems like a  good fit, because it's a round number, and  it's close to the
" current maximum number of lines we can display in a window (`&lines`).
" It makes sense to consider a file which  fits on a single screen as small; but
" not anything above.
